# Crochetprogram

This project is a part of my "art in motion" project. It generates procedural patterns using mathematical equations and functional programming techniques.

You can find the code in crochet.R file. I have used the tidyverse and purrr libraries in R language to create visually appealing patterns based on sin and cosine transformations.
These patterns defines the base of any knitting or crochet piece, represented visually. 

# Example Visualiation
Each time the code is run, different patterns are generated. You can see the example pattern in "choose_a_name.png" file. 

# Make your own visuals
You can clone the repo and run the program easily in any code editor. 
Make sure to install the 'tidyverse' package, if you don't have it already. 
`install.packages("tidyverse")'

# Save the visuals
Like the pattern formed? These lines helps you save the output 

ggsave("choose_a_name.png", height = 5, width = 5, units = "in", dpi = 800)
ggsave("choose_a_name.png", height = 5, width = 5, units = "in", dpi = 800
